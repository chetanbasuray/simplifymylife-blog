Digital clutter creeps up slowly—loose notes, forgotten bookmarks, half-written drafts. A solid organisation stack is the antidote. It keeps ideas searchable, projects moving, and sensitive data locked down. Here’s how to design a system that helps you **simplify your life** without sacrificing creativity.

Over the past decade I’ve tried every combination of note apps and bookmarking tools. The setup below finally stuck because it balances structure with flexibility. Let’s walk through it step by step.

### The Solution: Four Pillars of Digital Calm

Think of your digital life as four pillars: capture, organise, secure, and automate. Choose tools for each, and you’ll create a system that scales with your ambitions.

### Key Tools by Pillar

1. **Capture.** Use Drafts, Apple Notes, or Google Keep for quick capture. Send everything to Notion or Obsidian once a day.
2. **Organise.** Raindrop.io structures bookmarks with tags and collections; Notion databases link tasks to notes and resources.
3. **Secure.** 1Password stores logins, bank details, and shared vaults. Enable passkeys where available.
4. **Automate.** Zapier or Make routes highlights from Readwise Reader into your knowledge base and turns emails into tasks.

### How to Get Started

1. **Audit current tools.** Keep only one app per pillar to avoid duplication.
2. **Define naming conventions.** Use prefixes like “2025-ProjectName” to keep folders consistent.
3. **Set review cadences.** Block weekly time to process inboxes and monthly time to archive old projects.
4. **Secure access.** Turn on multi-factor authentication for every account and share vaults with family members responsibly.
5. **Document workflows.** Create a short SOP so you remember how notes flow from capture to archive.

### Tips and Alternatives

- **Use device widgets.** Place quick-capture buttons on your phone’s home screen.
- **Sync with calendar.** Send important notes to your calendar for context during meetings.
- **Keep it portable.** Export Notion or Obsidian data quarterly for offline backups.
- **Double down on decluttering.** Pair this system with our [digital declutter weekend](/posts/digital-decluttering) for best results.

### Final thoughts

A cohesive digital organisation system unlocks mental space, faster collaboration, and stronger privacy. Invest a few hours in the setup and it will serve you all year.
