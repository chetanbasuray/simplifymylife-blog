Germany’s banking market has long been divided between traditional banks with fees and fintechs with limited features. **C24 Bank** bridges this gap perfectly. Built by the CHECK24 group, it combines the digital speed of a neobank with the trust and features of a full German bank—and it pays you interest on your checking account.

If you are looking for a primary bank account that helps you budget better and grow your savings automatically, C24 is currently the strongest contender in the German market.

### Why Switch to C24?

Most free bank accounts strip away features. C24 does the opposite. Even the free "Smart" account includes features that other banks charge for, like sub-accounts with dedicated IBANs and instant SEPA transfers.

### Detailed Feature Breakdown

#### 1. Interest on Everything
Unlike traditional banks that pay 0% (or less) on checking accounts, C24 pays interest on your daily balance. This applies to both the main account and your pockets. It's a great way to fight inflation with zero effort.

#### 2. Multi-Banking and Contracts
Since C24 is part of the CHECK24 ecosystem, the app is brilliant at analyzing your contracts.
*   **Contract Recognition:** It automatically identifies your electricity, insurance, and internet contracts.
*   **Optimization:** It suggests cheaper alternatives if you're overpaying (optional, but handy).
*   **Multi-Banking:** You can link your other bank accounts (Sparkasse, Deutsche Bank, etc.) to see all your finances in one app.

#### 3. Free vs. Paid Models
*   **Smart (Free):** Includes account, card, 4 pockets, and interest. This is sufficient for 90% of users.
*   **Plus (€5.90/mo):** Adds insurance protection, more pockets, and higher cashback.
*   **Max (€9.90/mo):** Full metal card, extensive travel insurance, and priority support.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
*   **Interest:** Earning money on your checking account is a huge plus.
*   **Pockets:** The IBAN feature for pockets makes budgeting automated and robust.
*   **User Experience:** The app is fast, modern, and reliable.
*   **Instant Transfers:** Free SEPA Instant transfers.

**Cons:**
*   **Cash Deposits:** Partner shops charge a fee for depositing cash (via Barzahlen.de).
*   **Language:** The app is currently German-first. Support speaks English, but the UI is German.

### Conclusion

If you live in Germany, **C24 Bank** is arguably the best "all-rounder" bank account available right now. It combines the best features of fintechs (great app, free instant transfers) with the stability of a German banking license and interest rates.

For a free account that actively helps you manage your money better, C24 is our top recommendation.
