Managing money across borders used to mean juggling multiple bank accounts, decoding fine print, and paying mystery fees. **Wise** (formerly TransferWise) set out to fix all of that with transparent pricing and an app built for people who live, work, and travel globally.

    <h3>Why people switch to Wise</h3>
    <p>Wise started as a peer-to-peer money swap for friends frustrated by bank charges. Today it functions as a full multi-currency account with business-ready tools, local bank details, and consumer protections.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hold & convert</strong> money in 40+ currencies at the real mid-market rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Send</strong> to 170 countries with fees displayed before you confirm.</li>
      <li><strong>Spend</strong> like a local with the Wise debit card and virtual card numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### Everyday spending feels familiar

When you tap your Wise card overseas, the app automatically pulls from the balance with the best exchange rate. The experience mirrors a domestic card: freeze it instantly if it goes missing, generate virtual cards for safer online shopping, and add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay for contactless rides and checkouts.

<div class="tip-card">
  <p class="tip-card__eyebrow">Pro tip</p>
  <p>Enable balance alerts to nudge you when exchange rates move in your favor. It takes 30 seconds and saves you from checking rates manually every day.</p>
</div>

### Safety and transparency stay central

Wise is regulated in the regions where it operates and safeguards customer funds in established partner banks or low-risk government bonds. Two-factor authentication, biometric logins, and 24/7 fraud monitoring add extra layers of protection.

<div class="insight-card insight-card--neutral">
  <h4>Why the numbers make sense</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transparent pricing:</strong> Fees are itemized before you hit send—no hidden markups in the exchange rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Speedy settlement:</strong> In popular corridors like USD ⇄ EUR, transfers can arrive within minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Extra controls:</strong> Add an approval step for large payouts so nothing leaves your account unexpectedly.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Where Wise might fall short

- Wise isn’t a bank in most countries, so you won’t find loans or high-yield savings accounts.
- Large transfers (six figures and above) may prompt extra verification that slows things down.
- Some currencies still rely on the SWIFT network, which can add a day or two to arrival times.

### Who gets the most value?

<section class="grid gap-6 lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div class="persona-card">
    <h4>Frequent flyers &amp; expats</h4>
    <p>Keep travel budgets, tuition payments, and salary transfers in one place without juggling multiple banks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="persona-card">
    <h4>Freelancers &amp; contractors</h4>
    <p>Invoice in local currencies, get paid quickly, and convert earnings when exchange rates make sense.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<div class="insight-card insight-card--cta">
  <h4>Still deciding?</h4>
  <p>Compare Wise’s fee estimator with your existing bank, especially for recurring transfers. If the difference is more than a few basis points, Wise usually wins on both cost and speed.</p>
</div>

### Final thoughts

Wise shines when you need a single account to earn, hold, convert, and spend across currencies without mental math or sticker shock. Pair it with your home-country bank for lending products or long-term savings, and you’ll have a well-rounded global money toolkit.
