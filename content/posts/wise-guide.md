Managing money across borders used to mean juggling multiple bank accounts, decoding fine print, and paying mystery fees. **Wise** (formerly TransferWise) set out to fix all of that with transparent pricing and an app built for people who live, work, and travel globally.

> "It should be as easy to send money abroad as it is to send an email." — Wise co-founders Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus

### A modern take on international banking

Wise began in 2011 as a peer-to-peer platform that matched people who wanted to exchange currencies. Today it operates as a full multi-currency account with a debit card, local bank details in key markets, and business tools for freelancers and companies.

* Hold and convert money in 40+ currencies at the real mid-market rate.
* Send money to 170 countries with upfront fee disclosures before you confirm a transfer.
* Get local account numbers in regions like the US, UK, EU, Australia, and more to get paid like a local.

### Everyday spending made simple

Wise automatically converts to the best available balance when you pay with the Wise card abroad. You can freeze the card in a tap, generate virtual cards for online checkouts, and connect the account to Apple Pay or Google Pay for contactless payments.

**Why it works:**

- **Transparent pricing:** Fees are itemized before you hit send, so there are no "surprise" markups tucked into exchange rates.
- **Speedy settlement:** In popular currency corridors like USD ⇄ EUR, transfers often land within minutes.
- **Smart balance alerts:** Enable notifications to lock in favorable rates or move money when fees are lowest.

### Built-in safety features

Wise is regulated in the regions where it operates and holds customer funds in established partner banks or in low-risk government bonds. Two-factor authentication, biometric logins, and 24/7 fraud monitoring add extra layers of protection.

> Tip: Add an additional approval step for high-value transfers in the security settings. It’s a quick safeguard that keeps large payouts secure.

### When Wise might fall short

- Wise is not a traditional bank in most countries, so you won’t find products like loans or high-yield savings accounts.
- Large transfers (six figures and above) may trigger extra verification steps that slow things down.
- Some currencies still rely on the SWIFT network, meaning delivery can take a day or two.

### Final thoughts

Wise shines when you need a single account to earn, hold, convert, and spend across currencies without mental math or sticker shock. Pair it with your home-country bank for lending products or long-term savings, and you’ll have a well-rounded global money toolkit.
