Our laptops and phones should feel like tidy studios, not junk drawers. Yet most of us juggle overflowing inboxes, messy desktop folders, and endless push notifications. That constant noise drains energy. A digital declutter is one of the fastest ways to **simplify your life** and give every device a fresh start without expensive upgrades.

I run a quarterly declutter weekend with a playlist, a pot of tea, and a shared checklist. The transformation is immediate: laptops boot faster, my browser stops nagging me to update extensions, and I feel ready for deep work again. Let’s walk through the same routine so you can enjoy that fresh-start feeling too.

### The Solution: A Two-Session Reset

The Simplify My Life method splits decluttering into two focused sessions so you can maintain momentum without burnout.

### Key Features and Benefits

#### 1. Inbox sanity

Start with Clean Email or SaneBox to bundle newsletters and auto-delete expired alerts. Create filters for receipts and travel confirmations so they land in dedicated folders you review weekly.

#### 2. File harmony

Use Hazel on macOS or File Juggler on Windows to move screenshots, invoices, and downloads into tidy folders based on naming rules. Cloud storage apps now include built-in duplicate finders—run them monthly.

#### 3. Password hygiene

Update to 1Password or Bitwarden, enable passkeys where available, and audit shared vaults. Clear out ex-colleague access while you’re at it.

#### 4. App and extension pruning

Review your phone and browser: uninstall unused apps, disable noisy extensions, and group remaining tools by purpose. Less clutter means faster devices.

#### 5. Notification zen

Activate focus modes on iOS or Android, set Slack and Teams to deliver digests, and silence anything that doesn’t support your top priorities.

### How to Get Started

1. **Block two sessions.** Schedule a Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon sprint.
2. **Gather tools.** Install Clean Email, a password manager, and your chosen automation helper beforehand.
3. **Start with storage.** Delete duplicates, archive old projects, and upload photos to your preferred cloud service.
4. **Tackle security.** Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere and rotate important passwords.
5. **Rebuild routines.** Set weekly reminders to file receipts, inbox-zero your newsletters, and review notifications.

### Tips and Alternatives

- **Pair with physical decluttering.** Sort desk drawers while large backups run.
- **Try a focus timer.** Use Pomodoro blocks to keep the weekend fun, not draining.
- **Share the win.** Sync the checklist with family or co-workers so everyone maintains the new system.
- **Explore complementary guides.** Our [digital organization toolkit](/posts/tools-organize-digital-life) extends this routine with advanced workflows.

### Final thoughts

A tidy digital environment supports better focus, stronger security, and a calmer mind. Give yourself a weekend to reset, and every login will feel lighter.
