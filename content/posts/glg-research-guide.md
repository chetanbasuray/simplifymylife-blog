If you’ve spent years deep in an industry, there is demand for your insight. **GLG Research** connects subject-matter experts with investors, corporate strategy teams, and nonprofits that need real-world context—not generic reports.

My first GLG engagement came when a product team wanted to understand how mid-sized SaaS companies buy analytics tools. One hour of candid conversation translated into a consulting fee that would have taken several days of freelance work to earn. That is the kind of leverage Simplify My Life is all about: use the knowledge you already hold to buy back time without spinning up new hustles.

It fits the blog because GLG turns expertise into a calm, repeatable income stream. There is no rush to chase dozens of gigs; you set availability, vet requests, and step in only when the topic lights you up.

### How to stand out in the network

Be specific in your profile—list revenue ranges, software stacks, or regulatory frameworks you work with daily. That context helps GLG’s team match you to projects instantly. I also keep a short case-study paragraph ready to paste into pitch notes so clients see concrete wins.

### Payment cadence you can plan around

GLG reviews each session recording to ensure compliance, then processes payments in batches. Expect funds within two weeks, often sooner. The portal tracks invoices automatically, which means no spreadsheets on your end.

### Final thought

GLG is ideal if you enjoy strategic conversations and have hard-won experience to share. Instead of squeezing side gigs between commitments, you can take a single call that pays like a full project and still log off on time.
